## How to

```
(require '[clojure.string :as str])
(require 'gad2.core)
(require 'gad2.jobgraph)
(require '[com.stuartsierra.dependency :as dep])

(def jobgraph (gad2.core/jobgraph-from-config "examples/snakemake/config.edn"))

(def rules (gad2.parse-rulefiles/read-rules "examples/snakemake/rules.clj"))

(defn jobs-to-outpath [jobgraph]
  (for [rule (filter #(-> % first first keyword?) (:dependents jobgraph))]
    (let [rulename (-> rule first first)
          wildcards (->> rule second first second)
          wildcards-as-strings (->> wildcards vec sort flatten (map name))
          parts (flatten [(name rulename) wildcards-as-strings])]
      [[rulename wildcards] (str/join "/" parts)])))


(def rulegraph #com.stuartsierra.dependency.MapDependencyGraph
        {:dependencies {:bcftools-call #{:samtools-index :samtools-sort}
                        :plot-quals #{:bcftools-call}
                        :samtools-index #{:samtools-sort}
                        :samtools-sort #{:bwa-map}}
         :dependents {:bcftools-call #{:plot-quals}
                      :bwa-map #{:samtools-sort}
                      :samtools-index #{:bcftools-call}
                      :samtools-sort #{:bcftools-call :samtools-index}}})

(dep/immediate-dependencies jobgraph [:bcftools-call {:genome "hg19"}])
#{["bam/sorted.bam.bai" {:sample "B", :genome "hg19"}] ["bam/sorted.bam" {:sample "B", :genome "hg19"}] ["bam/sorted.bam" {:sample "A", :genome "hg19"}] ["bam/sorted.bam.bai" {:sample "A", :genome "hg19"}]}
```

## What remains?

Convert rules into code to execute.

- Instantiate rules
  - find path of input-files: given by wildcards and rule name (hash of code and input-files also?)
  - find path of output-files: given by wildcards and rule name (hash of code and input-files also?)

go through each (:dependents jobgraph). Then pick out :keyword-keys and you have the rule-name and the name of the file with the wildcards.
