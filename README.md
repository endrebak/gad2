## How to

```
(require 'gad2.core)
(require 'gad2.jobgraph)

(def jobgraph (gad2.core/jobgraph-from-config "examples/snakemake/config.edn"))

(def rules (gad2.parse-rulefiles/read-all "examples/snakemake/rules.clj"))

(def deps (:dependents jobgraph))

(let [rule (-> deps first first)
  rulename (-> rule first)
  wildcards (-> rule second sort)] [rulename wildcards])

;; must apply over whole file
(let [rule (-> deps first first)
  rulename (-> rule first name)
  wildcards (->> rule second sort flatten (map name))
  parts (flatten [rulename wildcards])] (str/join "/" parts))
```

## What remains?

Convert rules into code to execute.

- Instantiate rules
  - find path of input-files: given by wildcards and rule name (hash of code and input-files also?)
  - find path of output-files: given by wildcards and rule name (hash of code and input-files also?)

go through each (:dependents jobgraph). Then pick out :keyword-keys and you have the rule-name and the name of the file with the wildcards.
